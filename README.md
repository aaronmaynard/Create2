# ROS on Create2

This is the deployment branch of the ROS on Create2 project. This branch has purposefully been stripped to the bare tools to be downloaded onto the filesystem, and will include an executable file that will download dependencies if neccessary and install them.  The goal is to have a robot ready to go once the executable has finished.

## Key files

 - robot_installer, download and install files with default parameters
 - picreate_start, starts ROS and accompanying functions
